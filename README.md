# Monty
---
- Monty is an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
- Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. 

## The monty program

- Usage: `monty file`
  - where `file` is the path to the file containing Monty byte code.
- If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message `USAGE: monty file`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
- If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message `Error: Can't open file <file>`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
  - where `<file>` is the name of the file
- If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message `L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
  - where is the line number where the instruction appears.
  - Line numbers always start at 1
- The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
  - it executed properly every line of the file
  - it finds an error in the file
  - an error occured
- If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message `Error: malloc failed`, followed by a new line, and exit with status `EXIT_FAILURE`.
- You have to use `malloc` and `free` and are not allowed to use any other function from `man malloc` (realloc, calloc, …)


Task | Description
------- | -------
0.push, pall | Implement the `push` and `pall` opcodes.
 || **The push opcode**
 || The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
 ||  - Usage: `push <int>`
 ||    - where `<int>` is an integer
 ||  - if `<int>` is not an integer or if there is no argument given to `push`, print the error message `L<line_number>: usage: push integer`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
 ||    - where is the line number in the file
 ||  - You won’t have to deal with overflows. Use the `atoi` function
 || **The pall opcode**
 || The opcode `pall` prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
 ||  - Usage `pall`
 ||  - Format: see example
 ||  - If the stack is empty, don’t print anything
 || 
1.pint | Implement the `pint` opcode.
 || **The pint opcode**
 || The opcode `pint` prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
 ||   - Usage: `pint`
 ||   - If the stack is empty, print the error message `L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
 || 
2.pop | Implement the `pop` opcode.
 || **The pop opcode**
 || The opcode `pop` removes the top element of the stack.
 ||   - Usage: `pop`
 ||   - If the stack is empty, print the error message `L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
 || 
3.swap | Implement the `swap` opcode.
 || **The swap opcode**
 || The opcode `swap` swaps the top two elements of the stack.
 ||   - Usage: `swap`
 ||   - If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message `L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE` 
 || 
4.add |  Implement the `add` opcode.
 || **The add opcode**
 || The opcode `add` adds the top two elements of the stack.
 ||   - Usage: `add`
 ||   - If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message `L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
 ||   - The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
 ||         - The top element of the stack contains the result
 ||         - The stack is one element shorter
 || 
5.nop | Implement the `nop` opcode.
 || **The nop opcode**
 || The opcode `nop` doesn’t do anything.
 ||   - Usage: `nop`
